## 🧠 About the AI Agent

The AI uses the **Expectimax algorithm**, which:
- Simulates possible game states
- Applies a **heuristic scoring function** that values:
  - Empty tiles
  - Smoothness
  - Merge potential
  - Corner tile bonus
  - Weighted positions
- Dynamically adjusts search **depth** based on board complexity

It chooses moves that **maximize expected future score** — just like a real strategy player.
